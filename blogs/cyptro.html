                            <h2 class="text-info"> Top 5 Cryptocurrency in the world</h2>
                            <h4 class="text-info">1.Bitcoin
                            </h4>
                            <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that you can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank. Bitcoin’s creator is Satoshi Nakamoto. He originally described the need for “an electronic payment
                                system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.”
                            </p>
                            <p>Since its public launch in 2009, Bitcoin has risen dramatically in value. Although it once sold for under $150 per coin, as of March 1, 2021, one Bitcoin now sells for almost $50,000. Because its supply is limited to 21 million
                                coins, many expect its price to only keep rising as time goes on, especially as more large, institutional investors begin treating it as a sort of digital gold to hedge against market volatility and inflation.</p>
                            <h4 class="text-info">2.Ethereum
                            </h4>
                            <p>Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum, and its own programming language, called Solidity.</p>
                            <p>As a blockchain network, Ethereum is a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. The network's users can create, publish, monetize, and use applications on the platform, and use its Ether cryptocurrency
                                as payment. Insiders call the decentralized applications on the network "dapps."</p>
                            <h4 class="text-info">3.Tether
                            </h4>
                            <p>Tether is a controversial cryptocurrency with tokens issued by Tether Limited, which in turn is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. Tether Limited formerly falsely claimed that each token was backed by one United States dollar,
                                but on 14 March 2019 changed the backing to include loans to affiliate companies. The Bitfinex exchange was the subject of a lawsuit by the New York Attorney General of using Tether's funds to cover up $850 million in funds
                                missing since mid-2018. The investigation found that iFinex — the operator of Bitfinex and Tether — made false statements about the backing of the Tether and about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars between
                                the two companies to cover up the truth about massive losses by Bitfinex. According to the New York Attorney General, "Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie"

                            </p>
                            <h4 class="text-info">4.Binance Coin
                            </h4>
                            <p>Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency issued by Binance exchange and trades with the BNB symbol. Binance coin initially ran on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC 20 standard but has since become the native coin of the Binance chain.
                                Binance coin has a strict maximum of 200 million BNB tokens. As of April 2021, Binance Exchange is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, supporting more than 1.4 million transactions per second.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="text-info">5.Dogecoin
                            </h4>
                            <p>Dogecoin (DOGE) was created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The Dogecoin name and Shiba Inu logo are based on a meme. Unlike Bitcoin, which is designed to be scarce, Dogecoin
                                is intentionally abundant — 10,000 new coins are mined every minute and there is no maximum supply.

                            </p>
